# Hotel-Management-System
A hotel management system that handles room bookings and cancellations, using basic data structures like linked lists to manage hotel rooms and booking records. The system consists of two key classes: Room and RoomBooking, which represent hotel rooms and guest bookings respectively. These classes store essential details such as room ID, room rent, availability status, guest name, check-in date, and Aadhaar number.
The primary functionality of the system is encapsulated in the HotelManagementSystem class, which manages room addition, room availability checking, booking of rooms, cancellation of bookings, and maintaining booking history. The rooms are linked together in a linked list, and bookings are similarly organized as a linked list of RoomBooking objects.
The system starts with a set of predefined rooms, each with its own rent. The main menu offers several operations to users, such as booking a room, viewing available rooms, viewing active bookings, canceling a booking, and reviewing the booking history. Users can book rooms by specifying guest details and selecting from available rooms. If a room is booked, its availability status is updated, and the booking is added to the linked list of active bookings.
In case of cancellation, the system moves the booking from the active bookings list to a booking history list, allowing the room to be re-booked by another guest. The system ensures efficient management of hotel room inventory and booking data, providing a simple yet effective approach to handling hotel operations through a command-line interface.
This program demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, dynamic memory allocation, and linked list manipulation. It can serve as a foundational model for building more sophisticated hotel management systems with additional features like payment handling, customer feedback, or room services management.
